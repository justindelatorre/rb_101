Given the munsters hash below, modify the hash such that each member of the
Munster family has an additional "age_group" key that has one of three values
describing the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior). Your
solution should produce the hash below:

{ "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Lily" => {"age" => 30, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "senior" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "kid" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" } }

Note: a kid is in the age range 0 - 17, an adult is in the range 18 - 64 and a 
senior is aged 65+.

Alternate solution:

munsters.each do |name, details|
  case details["age"]
  when 0...18
    details["age_group"] = "kid"
  when 18...65
    details["age_group"] = "adult"
  else
    details["age_group"] = "senior"
  end
end
