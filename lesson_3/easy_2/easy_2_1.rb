In this hash of people and their age,

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

see if "Spot" is present.

Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this
solution?
=end

ages = {
  "Herman" => 32,
  "Lily" => 30,
  "Grandpa" => 402,
  "Eddie" => 10
}

puts ages.include?('Spot')
puts ages.member?('Spot')
puts ages.has_key?('Spot')
