The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after
midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight.
If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns the
time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm). Your method should work with any integer
input.

You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.

Examples:

time_of_day(0) == "00:00"
time_of_day(-3) == "23:57"
time_of_day(35) == "00:35"
time_of_day(-1437) == "00:03"
time_of_day(3000) == "02:00"
time_of_day(800) == "13:20"
time_of_day(-4231) == "01:29"
=end

MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60
HOURS_PER_DAY = 24
MINUTES_PER_DAY = HOURS_PER_DAY * MINUTES_PER_HOUR

def time_of_day(delta_minutes)
  delta_minutes = delta_minutes % MINUTES_PER_DAY
  hours, minutes = delta_minutes.divmod(MINUTES_PER_HOUR)
  format('%02d:%02d', hours, minutes)
end

puts time_of_day(0)
puts time_of_day(-3)
puts time_of_day(35)
puts time_of_day(-1437)
puts time_of_day(3000)
puts time_of_day(800)
puts time_of_day(-4231)
